# Extension hooks

Hooks are compiled into SynapsCLI. Extensions subscribe to them from the
`extension.hooks` array in `.synaps-plugin/plugin.json`.

## Manifest syntax

All tool calls:

```json
{ "hook": "before_tool_call" }
```

Only one tool:

```json
{ "hook": "before_tool_call", "tool": "bash" }
```

The `tool` filter is supported only for `before_tool_call` and
`after_tool_call`. It matches either the API-safe tool name or the runtime tool
name.

## Hook catalog and action matrix

| Hook | Required permission | Tool filter? | Allowed result actions | Purpose |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `before_tool_call` | `tools.intercept` | yes | `continue`, `block`, `confirm`, `modify` | Inspect/block/confirm/modify a tool call before execution |
| `after_tool_call` | `tools.intercept` | yes | `continue` | Observe tool input/output after execution |
| `before_message` | `privacy.llm_content` | no | `continue`, `inject` | Inspect the user message and optionally inject context |
| `on_message_complete` | `privacy.llm_content` | no | `continue` | Observe completed assistant responses |
| `on_compaction` | `privacy.llm_content` | no | `continue` | Observe completed conversation compaction summaries |
| `on_session_start` | `session.lifecycle` | no | `continue` | Observe session creation |
| `on_session_end` | `session.lifecycle` | no | `continue` | Observe session shutdown and transcript |

Unsupported result actions are ignored fail-open and logged as warnings.

## Result behavior

- `continue` lets SynapsCLI proceed.
- `block` prevents the hooked operation and surfaces the reason. It is accepted
  only on `before_tool_call`.
- `confirm` asks the runtime to get explicit user confirmation before proceeding.
  It is accepted only on `before_tool_call`. Interactive TUI streams prompt the
  user; headless/non-interactive call sites fail closed by blocking the tool call.
- `inject` accumulates text from all matching handlers and injects it into the
  model context. It is accepted only on `before_message`.
- `modify` replaces the tool input before execution. It is accepted only on
  `before_tool_call`; the first modifier stops the handler chain.

`on_message_complete` fires after an assistant response is added to session
history. It requires `privacy.llm_content` and is observe-only. The `message`
field contains concatenated assistant text blocks when present; tool-use blocks
are not serialized into `message`. Summary metadata is available in `data`,
including `content_block_count` and `has_tool_use`.

`on_compaction` fires after manual conversation compaction creates a replacement
session. It requires `privacy.llm_content` and is observe-only. The `message`
field contains the compaction summary. The `session_id` field is the new session
id, and `data` includes `old_session_id`, `new_session_id`, `message_count`, and
`source`.

`block`, `confirm`, and `modify` all stop the `before_tool_call` handler chain in
registration order. Put high-priority security policy extensions earlier in plugin
load order, and avoid granting trust to plugins that can modify tool inputs unless
you accept this ordering behavior.
