> **A Rust-native AI agent runtime that boots before your Node binary finishes `require()`-ing.**

Chat, orchestrate a crew of named subagents, or leave autonomous workers running 24/7 — all from one static binary. No Node. No Python. No Electron. No excuses.

## Why SynapsCLI?

- ⚡ **Sub-100ms cold start.** Single Rust binary, ~14K lines, `cargo build` and you're done.
- 🎭 **Named agents, not anonymous forks.** `subagent(agent: "spike", task: "...")` dispatches a crew member with their own soul. Watch them all work in a live panel.
- 🤖 **Autonomous mode that won't eat your wallet.** `watcher` supervises long-running agents with heartbeats, crash recovery, cost limits, and session handoff.
- 🎨 **18 themes.** cyberpunk, tokyo-night, gruvbox, catppuccin, nord, dracula, and friends. Your terminal deserves this.
- 🧠 **90%+ prompt cache hit rate.** Hand-tuned cache breakpoints beat auto-cache (tested: 90% vs 53%). Built for multi-hour sessions.
- ✍️ **Mid-stream steering.** Type while the model is generating to redirect in real time.
- 🔌 **MCP + plugins + skills.** Model Context Protocol servers spawn lazily. Skills load from markdown. Plugins ship as marketplaces.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaseebKhalid1507/SynapsCLI.git
cd SynapsCLI
cargo build --release
```

**Authenticate** — pick one:
```bash
./target/release/login                      # OAuth (Claude Pro/Max/Team)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."       # or API key
```

**Launch:**
```bash
./target/release/chatui
```

`/help` for commands. `/theme` to browse the candy store.

## Three Modes, One Binary

### 💬 `chatui` — Interactive TUI

Streaming, markdown, syntax highlighting, and a live panel showing every subagent you dispatched.

```
╭ ◈ 4 agents ────────────────────────────────────╮
│  ✓ spike    done                         12.3s  │
│  ⠹ chrollo  ⚙ read (tool #5)              8.1s  │
│  ✓ shady    done                          9.7s  │
│  ⠹ zero     thinking...                   4.2s  │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

### 📡 `chat` — Headless Pipe

Stdin/stdout. Perfect for scripts, CI, and UNIX pipelines that believe in themselves.

```bash
echo "explain this error" | cat error.log - | ./target/release/chat
```

### 🤖 `watcher` — Autonomous Daemon

```bash
watcher init scout      # scaffold an agent
watcher deploy scout    # run supervised
watcher status          # monitor the fleet
watcher logs scout -f   # tail the brain
```

Minimal agent config (`~/.synaps-cli/watcher/scout/config.toml`):

```toml
[agent]
name = "scout"
model = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
trigger = "watch"               # manual | always | watch

[trigger]
paths = ["./src"]
patterns = ["*.rs"]

[limits]
max_session_cost_usd = 0.50
max_daily_cost_usd = 10.0
```

Full schema in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Agents checkpoint state on exit and resume where they left off.

## Author
